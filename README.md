# Smartwatch-Data-Analysis

Smartwatches collect a wide range of data, such as heart rate, steps taken, calories burned, sleep patterns, and more. This data can be analyzed in many ways to gain insights into a person's health and fitness levels.

Analyzing the data collected on our fitness is one of the use cases of Data Science in healthcare.

I have analyzed the data collected by Smartwatch. The dataset I used is attached and can be found on Kaggle. This dataset was initially collected from 30 female users of the Fitbit smartwatch.
